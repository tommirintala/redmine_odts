= redmine_odts

If you  have existing Microsoft  Word or Open Office  documents, which
you need to transer into Redmine Wiki, then this plugin may help you.

This plugin is used to upload an existing ODT (openoffice) or DOCX (MS
Word) document to Redmine Wiki, so that each text paragraph will
create a Wiki text paragraph. In order to upload Microsoft Word
document, you can also export it to ODT format and upload it as ODT document.

Each document will create a new page in Wiki. Links in document will
create links in Wiki -page.

== Requirements

This plugin uses the following gems:

* ruby-xslt
* rubyzip


= Caveats

* Text paragraphs don't support bold, underline and italics format however.
* Some problems with bullets

= What not to expect

This plugin is not fully compliant with odt or docx standards (yes, I
know there are specifications), it is just a quick hack to upload the
text content to Wiki.
